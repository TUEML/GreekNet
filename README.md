# GreekNet
Gui based Greek letter classifier with a label tool to increase the training size or create your own dataset.
By simply chaning the table in the gui, it is possible to create any handwritten dataset.

Any model from models/ can be chosen, adjusted and then trained by simply running the corresponding *.py

Important: For inference, 
the name of the model has to be somewhere in the weight path because the correct preprocessing function is loading by a path lookup
